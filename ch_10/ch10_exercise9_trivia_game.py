9. Trivia Game
In this programming exercise, you will create a simple trivia game for two players. The program
will work like this:
• Starting with player 1, each player gets a turn at answering 5 trivia questions. (There
should be a total of 10 questions.) When a question is displayed, 4 possible answers are
also displayed. Only one of the answers is correct, and if the player selects the correct
answer, he or she earns a point.
• After answers have been selected for all the questions, the program displays the number
of points earned by each player and declares the player with the highest number of points
the winner.
To create this program, write a Question class to hold the data for a trivia question. The
Question class should have attributes for the following data:
• A trivia question
• Possible answer 1
• Possible answer 2
• Possible answer 3
• Possible answer 4
• The number of the correct answer (1, 2, 3, or 4)
The Question class also should have an appropriate _ _init_ _ method, accessors, and
mutators.
The program should have a list or a dictionary containing 10 Question objects, one for
each trivia question. Make up your own trivia questions on the subject or subjects of your
choice for the objects.
